<a href="http://heavybit.com">Heavybit's</a> Statement of Inclusion
=======

##We Value a Culture of Inclusion and Participation
<p>We unequivocally and without prejudice want to surround ourselves with as many talented people as we can. </p>
<p>This doesn’t happen in a monoculture. The best organization we can build is one that welcomes a diverse range of speakers, advisors, staff, and members. Those individuals traditionally left out of industry-shaping conversations should help design today’s developer ecosystem. </p>
<p>We believe that software is the future and in order for it to be a good one, it should be shaped by entrepreneurs, developers and contributors with a diverse set of values, skills, knowledge, experience and histories.  </p>
##We have a Zero Tolerance Policy
<p>We're committed to providing a harassment-free environment.  To that end, we have zero-tolerance for behavior that is counter to our above values including sexualized, demeaning, or insensitive content or inappropriate comments regarding age, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability, physical appearance, race, religion, or any other factor. Whether intentional or unintentional, we do not tolerate harassment of any kind.</p>
<p>If you have suggestions for changes to this policy, feel free to write a <a href="https://github.com/heavybit/conduct">pull request</a> or email <a href="mailto:conduct@heavybit.com">conduct@heavybit.com</a>.</p>
